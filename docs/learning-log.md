# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Heather Robbins
**Date:** 10/25/2025

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to create new repositories within my GitHub account.
- How to add a new file and new subdirectory.
- How to review reported issues.
- Issues are defined and organized within GitHub for team review and collaboration.
- Clear and well defined documentation is essential in the workflow for successful projects.

## Challenges and Solutions
Markdown is a new format me, I will need to get more familiar as the class goes on.  I do have experienc with html which I believe will help bridge the gap in learning a new formatting style.  I am also unfamiliar with GitHub as a whole and all of the open source language, projects and licensing information is new to me, so this will be a challenge and I'll need to rely on the resources provided for support.

## Connection to My GIS Career
I would like to start adding my past GIS projects within GitHub and use this platform to develop my already existing portfolio. Potential employers can use this to review my past work and experience.  I would like to contribute to existing open source projects and help in any capacity I can to the GIS community. 

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
